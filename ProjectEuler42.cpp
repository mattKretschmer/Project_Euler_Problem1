/*  --------- Project Euler Number 42 -----------
		//Coded triangle numbers
		
		Problem Statement-

	The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

 /*std::remove- takes a range, and removes all values equal to third input argument. Doesn't change the size of the array/string.Returns an iterator/pointer to end of new array.  I then use a.erase to delete extra space when I store the name.
 
 	std::getline(fin,a,',');//std::getline(input stream, "destination string, (optional) termination character);  Need to use this, else fin<< just gets all 5k names.

//Can check quickly if its a triangle number, by inverse of tn = (1/2)n(n+1): think about arithmetic, if (sqrt(8*score+1)-1 )/2 is integer, its a triangle num!
